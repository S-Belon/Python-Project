# Python-Project

We will analyze the space weather data from NASA and try to run a regression to find the correlation between each element. Then we can conduct a prediction of when the next event such as solar flares will take place and for how long they will last. Hopefully this will give us a result and some kind of measurement of predicting the upcoming events
